# StarRust

Sidescrolling space shooter made from Rust and Bevy

A lot of inspiration from
[belzile's platformer](https://github.com/belzile/platformer/tree/part-13)
albeit updated for bevy 0.8. and

[bevy rogue-like prototype](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_roguelike_prototype/blob/main/src/game/gameplay/enemy/spawner.rs)

Issues:

-   How to have generic spawn functions?
-   Add a spawnable trait to your bundle?
-   How to select and move waypoints?
