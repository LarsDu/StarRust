# StarRust

Open-source sidescrolling space shooter made with Rust and Bevy

Currently very unstable

Remaining work:

-   [ ] Resolve state management between main menu, game mode, and levels
-   [x] Add particle effects with bevy-hanabi (which needs an update for
        0.9-dev)
    -   [x] Particle Explosions
    -   [-] Particle background (Note: Deferred as this breaks wasm build
        support)
-   [ ] Volume control with bevy kira audio
-   [ ] More enemies
    -   [ ] A level 1 boss
    -   [ ] Asteroids
-   [ ] Powerup system
-   [ ] Weapon variants
    -   [ ] Cone shot
